        "If God wants us to do a thing he should make his wishes sufficiently clear. Sensible people will wait till he has done this before paying much attention to him. - Samuel Butler",
        "God will reveal Himself to a heart that is sincerely seeking Him.",
        "If the Damascus road experience was good enough for Saul, then it should be good enough for all of us, otherwise you have a God that is playing favorites."

      "name": "Argument from Reasonable Nonbelief",
      "description": "If God exists, we would expect that belief in Him would be more widespread and evident. However, the lack of compelling evidence and the existence of reasonable nonbelief suggest that God does not exist.",
      "quotes": []
    },
    {
      "name": "Argument from Divine Hiddenness/Silence",
      "description": "If God exists and desires a relationship with humanity, it would be expected that He would make His presence and intentions more apparent. The perceived silence or hiddenness of God provides reasons to doubt His existence.",
      "quotes": []
    }
  ],
  "additional_comment": "The argument from nonbelief is arguably much stronger than the problem of evil because it deals with concepts, such as relationships, that are well within the understanding of humans. Not only can atheists refer to their own experiences, but we can also check the historical record across cultures to see if God communicates in a way we might expect, if he existed."
